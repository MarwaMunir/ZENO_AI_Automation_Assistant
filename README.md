üß™ Developer Tips
To test any feature individually, use the top 4 module files inside the ELECTRON APP folder , each corresponds to a separate feature.It will save the hustle of having to download the electron app locally and other depedencies.

Also if you prefer text based response, use the feature module individually rather than calling them from Zeno app.
